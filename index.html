        <h2 style="   white-space: nowrap; color: #e9658d">Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h2> 
        <p style="   line-height: 1.4; ">One of my favorite Nintendo Switch games is <i>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</i>  In this 2017-released title, our protagonist saves the world and his love by slaying monsters, collecting equipment, and solving puzzles.  This open-world game is sure to keep you preoccupied with its breath-taking soundtrack, countless hours of gameplay, and DLC options.  I would reccomend this game to anybody.  It is truly an experience for anyone to enjoy.<br></p>

        <h2 style="  white-space: nowrap; color: #e9658d">Super Smash Brothers Ultimate</h2> 
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.4;"> When playing with friends, my go-to Nintendo Switch game would be <i>Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.</i>  Not only can you play this action-packed thrill ride with up to 8 people at the same time, you can even fight your friends with a character list comprised of seventy-four fighters.  This game is sure to keep anybody entertained for quite some time.  When playing Super Smash Brothers, I love playing Kirby.  <br></p>

        <h2 style="  white-space: nowrap; color: #e9658d">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h2> 
        
        <p style="   line-height: 1.4; ">Maybe endless adventure or a free-for-all brawl isn't something you would be interested in.  If these titles aren't your cup of tea, then why not try a relaxing town simulator where you can build a neighborhood from scratch, make friends, and watch your community grow!  It is my favorite game to play after a long stressful day of class.  This game even allows you to connect with your friends and visit each other's islands, where you can even buy and sell produce.<br></p>
